=== Introduction

Plosxom is a blogsoftware written in PHP. It is a rewrite of phposxom.
Blogposts are stored in textfiles, categories are simple directories.
Plosxom has a comprehensive plugin api, which allows to add almost any
functionality or to replace existing functionality.

=== Details

Phposxom were itself a php rewrite of blosxom, but the developer has
abandoned the project. I am using it, because I cannot run perl where
my site is hosted and because it is small. However, the sourcecode of
phposxom were nearly unmaintanable, inefficient and bad styled (sorry
Robert). Since I use it on an every day basis, I decided to completely
rewrite it. Plosxom was born.

Many of the blosxom forks out there have been abandoned too, especially
the php ports (there are lots of it). None of them seemed to be a
usefull base for me. Most of them justify their decision that if it
were developed further it would become too far to existing projects
like wordpress and they didn't want to re-invent the wheel.

While I share this view in general, I also see a lot of disadvantages
with wordpress: its storage backend can't be replaced. It depends on
MySQL, which is the worst database system on the planet. With plosxom
you could write a sqlite backend or whatever you like, even a mysql
backend. Wordpress is also a "large biest", it contains a lot of
source code and thus a lot of problems, especially from the security
point of view.

Speaking of security - plosxom were developed with strong security in
mind. Since there is almost no cgi input being used in the software,
this goal were not difficult to achive. Everything which gets into
the script will be filtered for bogus characters. Future attacks are
hopefully prevented using this technique.

There is no administration backend delivered with plosxom, because
you write textfiles (or upload them) - that's all. Without admin
backend, the blog can't be hijacked like most other blogs could be.

The plosxom core engine is very small. In fact, I wrote it in just
two days. This sounds like a hell of a crap, but it isn't. Much
functionality is provided by plugins, even core functions, such as
text file management, is coded as a plugin. Since we are using smarty
as our template engine there are endless possibilities to enhance
plosxom. You can write a simple plugin along with a simple smarty
function and that's it.

For now, plosxom doesn't provide built-in comment support due to
security reasons. Instead comments can be outsourced to Haloscan.
However, perhaps someone will write a comment plugin some day,
who knows.



=== Installation

Download the latest tarball of plosxom. Copy it to your webspace
and unpack it:

% tar xvfz plosxom-core-x.xx.tar.gz

Make sure your webserver is able to access all the files. Read
permissions are sufficient.



=== Configuration

Next, edit the plosxom configuration file etc/plosxom.conf. Here
is an explanation of the variables.

This is the physical location of the plosxom installation on the
filesystem.

lib_path = /path/to/webspace/plosxom/lib

Where are the templates located. This directory must be visible
to the webserver, because templates provide css stylesheets, which
are required.

template_path = //path/to/webspaceplosxom/templates

The directory where pre-compiled templates can be stored. Must
be writable for the webserver.

tmp_path = /tmp

Here are the postings stored. You can create subdirectories, which
will then considered as categories. Only files with a .txt extension
will be indexed. To hide a file from the blog, change its permissions
so that the webserver can't read it anymore. Consider this as
"draft posting" feature.

data_path = /path/to/webspaceplosxom/data

Where plugins are located.

plugin_path = /path/to/webspace/plosxom/plugins

The name of the template. Each template is a directory beneath
the template_path.

template = default

The overall name of your blog.

blog_name = BLOGNAME

Add a short description, a oneliner is far enogh.

blog_title = BLOGDESCRIPTION

The number of postings to be displayed on the blog front page.

postings = 10

Your name.

author = yourname

Add a link to your homepage or something which will be used to
underline the author name.

author_link = http://yourpage/

This is the http url of the plosxom blog.

whoami = http://yourpage/plosxom/plosxom.php

This is the base url of the blog, without the plosxom.php file.
Will be used to create image or stylesheet links.

baseurl = http://yourpage/plosxom/


=== Preinstalled Plugins

The following plugins are preinstalled with plosxom:

  page plugin:   edit etc/page.conf, add the path to the data path
                 where static pages have to stored. A sample pages
	         directory is supplied with plosxom.

  links plugin:  edit etc/blogroll.txt.

  categories:    nothing to do.
 
  feed plugin:   nothing to do.

  technorati:    nothing to do, just add tags to your posts on the
                 last line like tag:blog, tag:test, etc...


=== Posting

Now you are done. Start blogging by creating txt files under the
data_path directory. The first line will be used as the posting
title.


=== Plugins

To install a plugin, download it from the Plugin page:

http://code.google.com/p/plosxom/wiki/Plugins

Copy the .php file to the plugin_path directory. If the plugin
contains further installation instructions follow it precisely.
That's it. Plugin will be loaded automatically by plosxom.

In most cases you'll have to add some code snippet to your template.
How to do this will be documented in the plugin.



=== Templates

To install a template, download it from the Templates page:

http://code.google.com/p/plosxom/wiki/Templates

Uninstall the .zip file inside the template_path directory. This
will create a new directory with the name of the template. Add
this name to your configfile by replacing the variable template
with it.



=== Update

To update your installation, go to the Download page and download
the latest patch file. Unpack this patch in your plosxom directory.
A patch tarball only contains the changed files and will not
overwrite any configuration files or templates. If the default
template has changed, a .updated file will be installed instead.
You may then adjust your current template with the changes or
just replace it with the new version.



=== Problems

If you encounter problems, file a Bugreport if you think it is a
bug:

Send me an email if you need help installing or configuring

Thanks for using plosxom and keeping the opensource movement alive!
