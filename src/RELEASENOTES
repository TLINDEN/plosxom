Release 1.06 fixes and new plugins
-----------------------------------

All templates have been changed to use
smarty's eval() function for post text.
This way blog postings (and pages) may
contain any valid smarty code. You can
install smarty plugins and use them in
your blog. Also plosxom plugins may make
use of this feature - the new youtube
plugin is such a plugin.

New plugin added - youtube plugin. It
allows the user to embed youtube videos
in a blog post. Optionally videos can
also be linked instead of embedded, and
the link can be a text string or the
video preview image.

Added admin plugin, which is a webinterface
to maintain all aspects of the blog.

Readme file has been rewritten, it also
contains some help about the admin
backend.

A install.php gui installer has been
added which makes it easier to install
plosxom for newbiews.

The page plugin now contains an admin
plugin so that one can maintain static
pages from admin backend. The same applies
for the technorati-tag plugin.

An rpc-ping admin plugin has been added,
it is also possible to issue rpc-pings
after a posting has been created or
changed.

The plosxom core classes "Plosxom, Registry
and Plugin" have been outsourced into
external files (residing in the lib/ directory)
for easier maintenance.


Release 1.05 fixes and new plugins
-----------------------------------

Some of the previously plugins have been added
to the core plosxom distribution. This makes
things for newbies easier.

Also two new templates were added, try them out!



Release 1.04 - bug fixes
-----------------------------------

Plugin interface has been cleaned up. The
standard plugin has a new function fetch_categories(),
which can be used to create category listings.

A new plugin "categories" does this exactly.

A couple of minor typos and bugs have been
fixed too.




Release 1.03 - bug fixes
-----------------------------------

Posting title extraction has been fixed.

The default template now has language support,
english is the standard language from now on,
but german is also available. See lang.conf
in the etc/ directory.

Archiving fixed, there were lots of bugs.

The default template has a nuew sub template
just for postings which is shared for single
postings and post listings.

A new config variable 'author_email' has
been added.

Content-type can be overwritten by plugins.

The template class ($smarty) contains a
reference of the postings array, which makes
it possible for plugins to access it.






Release 1.02 - first public release
-----------------------------------

The core has been written from scratch.
Most things do mostly as they should.
