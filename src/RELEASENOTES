Release 1.05 fixes and new plugins
-----------------------------------

Some of the previously plugins have been added
to the core plosxom distribution. This makes
things for newbies easier.

Also two new templates were added, try them out!



Release 1.04 - bug fixes
-----------------------------------

Plugin interface has been cleaned up. The
standard plugin has a new function fetch_categories(),
which can be used to create category listings.

A new plugin "categories" does this exactly.

A couple of minor typos and bugs have been
fixed too.




Release 1.03 - bug fixes
-----------------------------------

Posting title extraction has been fixed.

The default template now has language support,
english is the standard language from now on,
but german is also available. See lang.conf
in the etc/ directory.

Archiving fixed, there were lots of bugs.

The default template has a nuew sub template
just for postings which is shared for single
postings and post listings.

A new config variable 'author_email' has
been added.

Content-type can be overwritten by plugins.

The template class ($smarty) contains a
reference of the postings array, which makes
it possible for plugins to access it.






Release 1.02 - first public release
-----------------------------------

The core has been written from scratch.
Most things do mostly as they should.
