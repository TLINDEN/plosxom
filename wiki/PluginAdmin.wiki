= Download =

While the admin plugin can be downloaded [http://plosxom.googlecode.com/files/admin-1.00.zip separately] it is not recommended to do so. Instead use the latest version of plosxom which includes the latest admin backend.

However, if you intend to download and install it manually, please consider the following hints:

 * the admin plugin requires at least plosxom *1.06* or higher
 * copy the files admin.php, admin.nfo to your plugin directory
 * copy the files admin-users.cionf and lang-admin.conf to your etc directory
 * copy all the other files and directories to templates/shared/
 * add a link to the admin backend:
   {{{<a href="{$config.whoami}/admin">Login</a>}}}
