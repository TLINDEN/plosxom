Administration Plugin


= Details =

The admin plugin is currently under development and not released yet.

[http://plosxom.googlecode.com/svn/plugins/admin/ Check the Subversion repository for updates meanwhile].

= Development State =

*Last updated: 24.01.2008*

For now the following functionality is implemented so far:

  * admin login using http basic authentication
  * it uses its own template and is therefore fully customizable too
  * supports plugins itself (admin-plugins), an example is the [http://plosxom.googlecode.com/svn/plugins/page/plugin_admin_page.php static-page admin pluign], which is complete
  * create, edit and remove of blog postings
  * wysiwyg editor (tinymce)
  * media file management (no upload yet)
  * config file management, the user can directly edit configs from the admin backend
  * user management
  * installation and deletion of plugins, plugins can also deactivated

Missing functionality as of *24.01.2008*:

  * media file upload and delete function
  * selected images will not properly inserted into posts from tinymce
  * template management
  * rpc ping (although the code backend already exists, I'm using it every day)
  * admin plugin for tag generation
  * documentation (online help)
  * localization (using admin-lang.conf and smarty lang support)
