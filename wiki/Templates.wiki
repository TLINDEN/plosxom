= Introduction =

This is a list of official plosxom templates.

== blog.txt ==

This is a port of the [http://www.plaintxt.org/themes/blogtxt/ blog.txt] template by [http://scottwallick.com/ Scott Wallick] (shouts and thanks!). The original blog.txt template were written for wordpress. It consisted of a number of PHP files, which were practically not portable it smarty. So I took the theme output on some wordpress blog using this theme and ported this to smarty. Of course all of the wordpress specific stuff has been removed.

To install the template, download the zip file below and unpack it into your template directory. Make sure the webserver has read permssions to the newly created directory "blogtxt".
