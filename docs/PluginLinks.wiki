= Install =

1. copy links.php to your plugins directory.

2. create one or more link configs in your etc directory. In your template
you can then loop over links by config. This makes it possible
to maintain page links separately from blogroll or the like.

Format is simple:

{{{
link name = link url
}}}

for example:

{{{
Peppos Incarnation = http://foo.bar/
}}}

Empty lines and lines starting with # will be ignored as
always in in configs.

3. add some code to your template to loop over the links of
a particular links config file, eg:


{{{
   <div class="links">
     <h4>Blogroll</h4>
     <ul>
      
      {links config="blogroll.conf" template="<a href='%1'>%2</a> "}
    </ul>
   </div>
}}}

The template function "links" exported by the links module
requires 2 parameters:

 * config   - the link config file you are referring to
 * template - how the link shall appear. %1 will be used for the url and %2 for the link name.

That's it - now add links to your link configs as you like!
